Description
************

The dataset is provided in the 'data' folder:

I. data/
  a. umpire_non_umpire - Contains files named umpire_xxx.jpg and non_umpire_xxx.jpg
  b. umpire_poses  - Contains files named no_ball_xxx.jpg, out_xxx.jpg, sixes_xxx.jpg, 
                     wide_xxx.jpg and no_action_xxx.jpg
  
  The train and test data were split as presented in the reference paper.

********************************************************************************************************************
NOTE: Unzip the folders within the same 'data' directory and run the scripts from the 'code' directory.
********************************************************************************************************************

II. code/
  a. inception - Contains code to:
                (i) generate deep features for model 1 and model 2 based on pretrained 
                    inceptionv3 model.
                (ii) train and save SVM classifiers for model 1 and model 2 based on inceptionv3 features.
                (iii) generate the summary from a cricket video based on respective classifier.
  b. vgg19 - Contains code to:
             (i) generate deep features for model 1 and model 2 based on pretrained 
                 vgg19 model.
             (ii) train and save SVM classifiers for model 1 and model 2 based on vgg19 features.
             (iii) generate the summary from a cricket video based on respective classifier.

NOTE: The cricket video to geenrate the highlights is not provided in this repo.

III. features/
  a. inception - Contains the deep features extracted using the Inception V3 model.
  b. vgg19  - Contains the deep features extracted using the Inception V3 model.

Each folder contains features for the respective models to perform cricket highlights generation.

Model 1 - Classify between an Umpire image and a Non Umpire image (Those images that are umpire will be passed to
          Model 2 for classification in the video summarization pipeline)
Model 2 - Classify between the five Umpire action classes (Six, No Ball, Out, Wide, No Action)

IV. models/
  a. inception_svm - Contains the SVM model 1 and model 2 trained on inceptionV3 features.
  b. vgg19_svm - Contains the SVM model 1 and model 2 trained on vgg19 features.

V. results_summary/
  Contains the output summarized cricket highlights.
