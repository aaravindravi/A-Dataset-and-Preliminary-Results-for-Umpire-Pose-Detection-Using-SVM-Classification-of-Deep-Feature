Description
************

The following dataset contains four folders:
I.
  a. model1_train - Contains files named umpire_xxx.jpg and non_umpire_xxx.jpg
  b. model1_test  - Contains files named umpire_xxx.jpg and non_umpire_xxx.jpg

NOTE: While using the datasets with the provided code, please copy the files into a separate folder name with the
      respective class name. Alternately, the code can be modified to read the classname directly from each filename of the image.

II.
  a. model2_train - Contains files named no_ball_xxx.jpg, out_xxx.jpg, sixes_xxx.jpg, 
                    wide_xxx.jpg and no_action_xxx.jpg
  b. model2_test  - Contains files named no_ball_xxx.jpg, out_xxx.jpg, sixes_xxx.jpg, 
                    wide_xxx.jpg and no_action_xxx.jpg

NOTE (Same as above): While using the datasets with the provided code, please copy the files into a separate folder name with the
                      respective class name. Alternately, the code can be modified to read the classname directly from
                      each filename of the image. 

The datasets have been split into train and test as used in the paper.

Model 1 - Classify between an Umpire image and a Non Umpire image (Those images that are umpire will be passed to
          Model 2 for classification in the video summarization pipeline)
Model 2 - Classify between the five Umpire action classes (Six, No Ball, Out, Wide, No Action)
